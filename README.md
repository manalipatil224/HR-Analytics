Objective was to create a dashboard where we can insights by which Attrition rate can be reduced.
This dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard empowers HR professionals to proactively manage attrition and cultivate a thriving workforce.
Created multiples KPIs and DAX formulas.

Age: Employees between 26 and 35 years old are leaving at a significantly higher rate than other age groups.
Salary: Many exiting employees earned salaries below $5,000 (or your equivalent currency).
